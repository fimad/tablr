Tablr
=====

Tablr is a simple command line utility for converting back and forth between a
simple table markup language and pretty ASCII tables. It reads markup on
standard in and writes the corresponding ASCII table to standard out.

The `-r` flag may be given to convert from an ASCII table to markup also reading
and writing on standard in and out.

Markup
------

The tables generated by Tablr are currently very simple. A table is composed of
a list of rows, each row may either by a divider or a list of cells. All rows in
a table have the same number of cells.

A row of cells is specified on a single line with a `|` character between each
cell.

A divider row is specified by a single line containing one or more `-`
characters and nothing else.

Example
-------

For example, the given markup:

```
Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3
-
foo | bar | baz
just the first
||just the last
```

Will produce the following table when piped through `tablr`:

```
+----------------+----------+---------------+
| Header 1       | Header 2 | Header 3      |
+----------------+----------+---------------+
| foo            | bar      | baz           |
| just the first |          |               |
|                |          | just the last |
+----------------+----------+---------------+
```

VIM Integration
---------------

Tablr was originally created with VIM integration in mind. You can add the
following to your `~/.vimrc` file to automatically convert the paragraph under
your cursor back and forth between tables and markup.

```
nnoremap <leader>at vip:!tablr<cr>
nnoremap <leader>ut vip:!tablr -r<cr>
```
